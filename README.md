# minimal-zea-viewer

This is a minimal sample application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and
WebComponents. It is a simple, framework agnostic sample that shows how to load
and render various file formats, while providing a simple tree view to explore
the model structure.

## Running the demo

Simply run an HTTP server in the same folder as the sample and load the index.html
file.

For example, run in your terminal:

```bash
npx http-server
```

Then go to:

[http://localhost:8080/?zcad=data%2FHC_SRO4.zcad](http://localhost:8080/?zcad=data%2FHC_SRO4.zcad)

## Loading data

You can load data by drag and drop, or using a pick file dialog.
